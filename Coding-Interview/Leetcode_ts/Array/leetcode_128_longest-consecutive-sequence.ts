128. Longest Consecutive Sequence

https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-consecutive-sequence/

Consecutive sequence means that the numbers are in sequence, but not necessarily in order.

O(N) solution is required.   Meas the solution should use Hashtable.

Hashset h: key
Check whether h contains (key - 1) or not
if not, key is a lower bound, check key + 1, key + 2, until key + 1 + 1 is not in h,
key ~ key + 1 in h, length is 1.
Find the max of 1s

Time complexity: O(N) , every element is visited twice.
Space complexity: O(N)
