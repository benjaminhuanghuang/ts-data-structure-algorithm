202. Happy Number

https://leetcode.com/problems/happy-number/

 A happy number is a number defined by the following process:
  Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits,
  and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay),
  or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1.
  Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers.
