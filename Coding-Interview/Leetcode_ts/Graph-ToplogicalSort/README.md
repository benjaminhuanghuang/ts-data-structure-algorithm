# Topological Sort

DFS, add the node the visited array befr popping the stack.
If a node is already added to visited, there is a cycle.
Answer is the reverse of the visited array.

## When to use

## Complexity

Time Complexity: DFS O(V + E)
Space Complexity:

## Template

```js
for each node:
    if not marked:
        if (dfs(node) == CYCLE) return CYCLE
    return OK

dfs(node) :
    if node is marked as visited: return OK
    if node is marked as visiting: return CYCLE
    mark node as visiting
    for each new_node in node.neight
        if dfs (new_node) == CYCLE: return CYCLE
    mark node as visited
    add node to the head of orderd-list, sort the nodes
return OK
```

```js
function findInDegree(graph) {
    const inDegree = new Map();
    for (let node of graph.keys()) {
        inDegree.set(node, 0);
    }
    for (let node of graph.keys()) {
        for (neighbor of graph.get(node)) {
            inDegree.set(node, neighbor.get(node) + 1);
        }
    }
    return inDegree;
}
// BSF
function topoSort(graph) {
    const res = [];
    const q = [];
    const inDegree = findInDegree(graph);
    for (let node of inDegree.keys()) {
        if (inDegree.get(node) == 0) {
            q.push(node);
        }
    }
    while (q.length > 0) {
        const node = q.shift();
        res.push(node);
        for (let neighbor of graph.get(node)) {
            inDegree.set(neighbor, inDegree.get(neighbor) - 1);
            if (inDegree.get(neighbor) == 0) {
                q.push(neighbor);
            }
        }
    }
    return (graph.size === res.length) ? res : null;
}
```
