# Heaps P143

A heap is a data structure that organizes elements based on priority, ensuring the highest-priority
element is always at the top of the heap.

Priority queue
A priority queue is a special type of heap that follows the structure of min-heaps or max-heaps but
allows customization in how elements are prioritized (e.g., prioritizing strings with a higher number
of vowels).

| Operation | Time complexity | Description |
|-----------|----------------|-------------|
| Insert | O(log(n)) | Adds an element to the heap, ensuring the binary tree remains correctly ordered. |
| Deletion | O(log(n)) | Removes the element at the top of the heap, then restructures the heap to replace the top element. |
| Peek | O(1) | Retrieves the top element of the heap without removing it. |
| Heapify | O(n) | Transforms an unsorted list of values into a heap [1]. |
