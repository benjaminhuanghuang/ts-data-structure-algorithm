Solution: Greedy

Jump as far as possible but lazily.

[2, 3, 1, 1, 4]
i    nums[i]   steps   near   far
-      -         0       0     0
0      2         0       0     2
1      3         1       2     4
2      1         1       2     4
3      1         2       4     4
4      4         2       4     8

Time complexity: O(n)
Space complexity: O(1)
